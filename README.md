[Demo](https://prchecklist.herokuapp.com/motemen/test-repository/pull/2)

![Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

## Features

- Provides checklists base on "release" pull requests which have multiple "feature" pull requests that are about to merged into master by the "release" one (see the demo)
- Each checklist item can be checked by GitHub accounts who have access to the repository
- Checklists can have multiple stages (eg. QA and production)
- Notifies to Slack on each check or checklist completion
- Customizable by a .yml file on repositories

## Configuration

By a file named `prchecklist.yml` on the top of the repository you can customize prchecklist's behavior.

For example it seems like:

~~~yaml
stages:
  - qa
  - production
notification:
  events:
    on_check:
      - ch_check
    on_complete:
      - ch_complete
  channels:
    ch_complete:
      url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ch_check:
      url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
~~~

This configuration says:

- This repository has two stages (qa, production), which means two checklists are created for each release pull requests,
- And when a checklist item is checked, a Slack notification is sent,
- And when a checklist is completed, a Slack notification is sent to another Slack channel.
